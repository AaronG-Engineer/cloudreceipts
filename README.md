CloudReceipts is an AI-powered receipt management system that automates expense tracking using AWS Lambda, S3, Textract, DynamoDB, and SES. When a receipt PDF is uploaded, it extracts key details, stores them in a structured database, and sends an email notificationâ€”eliminating manual data entry for seamless cloud-based organization.
